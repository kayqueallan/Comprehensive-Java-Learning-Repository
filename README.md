# Repository on Java and Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to my repository on Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! This space is dedicated to documenting and organizing the concepts and information I am exploring in the Java language and the practice of object-oriented programming.

## Content

In this repository, you will find a collection of detailed notes and resources related to Java and OOP. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and accessible guide to facilitate understanding and practice with Java and programming concepts. The content includes:

### Fundamentals of Programming
- Basic programming concepts, including control structures, data types, and fundamental operations.
- Advanced concepts such as algorithms and data structures.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Fundamental OOP concepts, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Detailed topics on cohesion, object references, methods, constructors, and more.

### How Java Works
- Structure and architecture of the Java language, including the difference between bytecode and the role of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Download and configuration of the JDK, environment variables, and use of the IntelliJ Community IDE.

### Java Environments
- Different Java environments, such as the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and the JDK (Java Development Kit), and their differences.
- Installation and configuration of essential tools.

### Java Code Structure
- Basic structure of a Java program, including packages, classes, methods, and variables.
- Code organization, comments, and best practices for structuring.

### Compilation and Execution
- How to compile and run Java programs, including commands and best practices for manual compilation and IDE use.

### Code Organization
- Tips and techniques for organizing Java code into packages and managing project structure.
- Best practices for modular programming and code management.

## Experience and Education

I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at PUC Minas, where I am taking the courses of Modular Programming and Modular Programming Laboratory. Additionally, I am applying and expanding knowledge gained in Systems Analysis and Development (AEDS 1), where I worked with the C language and developed my programming logic.

To complement my education and deepen my knowledge of Java and OOP, I am taking the **"Virado no Jiraya"** course on the YouTube platform, available in the [Maratona Java Virado no Jiraya playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKjFuX91G5Q&list=PL62G310vn6nFIsOCC0H-C2infYgwm8SWW), which has over 88 hours of content covering topics from fundamentals to advanced aspects of the language and its utilities.

Additionally, I have a total of 40 hours in Modular Programming Laboratory and 80 hours of Modular Programming, which has provided me with significant practical experience in development.

This repository is a key part of my development as a Java programmer and is continuously updated with new discoveries and improvements. Feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute with suggestions and corrections. I hope you find this material useful and inspiring.
